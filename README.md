# WebAppCourses
A project from my web application project that utilized a database of courses to insert, update, delete data


I created this web application to practice the skills I was learning during the Web App course I took at Siena taught by Eric Breimer. The landing page of this site is a page where a user is able to join or log in to edit and manage their profile and a list of courses they have taken. In addition, there is also an admin log in that can manage the users. It is written in PHP to retrieve data from a MySQL database and create reusable HTML markup. I used Bootstrap library for styling. During this course I learned about request and response processes, importance of separating an application's content, presentation, and behavior and how to implement a single integrated application using different languages

Technologies used for this: PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JSON, MySQL
